Project Description
A website that creates a digital wardrobe by scanning and organizing existing clothes, uses AI to suggest outfits based on body type, occasion, weather, and personal style. Reduces unnecessary shopping by recommending how to mix & match existing items before purchasing new ones.

The Problem statement
Consumers often struggle with selecting the right clothing due to uncertainties about fit, body type compatibility, and overwhelming fashion choices. Additionally, many shoppers over-purchase or fail to utilize their existing wardrobes efficiently, leading to excessive textile waste and environmental harm. Traditional fashion shopping lacks personalized recommendations and does not consider sustainability when suggesting new purchases.

The Solution

Develop an AI-powered Virtual Closet & Sustainable Fashion Assistant that:
✅ Creates a digital wardrobe by scanning and organizing existing clothes.
✅ Uses AI to suggest outfits based on body type, occasion, weather, and personal style.
✅ Reduces unnecessary shopping by recommending how to mix & match existing items before purchasing new ones.
✅ Provides sustainable shopping recommendations, prioritizing eco-friendly and ethical brands.
✅ Incorporates a Virtual Try-On feature to help users visualize outfits before purchasing.
